# OBS EVENTS — PROGRESS

Current phase: 0
Last session: 2026-07-08 — Phase 0 in progress (task 0.1 done)
Stack: MERN (MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose · Express · React 18 + Vite · Node 20) — see obs-events-build-plan.md v1.1

## Phase 0 — Foundation
- [x] 0.1 Repo scaffold: client/ (Vite + React 18 + Tailwind + React Router v6), server/ (Express + Mongoose, ES modules, nodemon), root npm workspaces
- [ ] 0.2 Mongoose models (§5); Atlas or local single-node replica set; seed.js: admin, 12 categories, 108 chapters (type, tier, pillarGroup, ecosystemTier A–E, isFlagship, sortOrder — Appendix A), CMS stubs
- [ ] 0.3 Auth: register/login (bcrypt 12), refresh rotation, Google id_token verify, forgot/reset, middleware (requireAuth, requireRole, zod validate, rate limits), error handler
- [ ] 0.4 Utils: S3 presigned PUT/GET, mailer (Nodemailer SMTP, provider-agnostic, + EmailLog), nextSeq() counters, slugify
- [ ] 0.5 Client base: layout + navbar/footer, auth pages, role guards in layouts, axios client with silent-refresh interceptor
- [ ] EXIT: email + Google signup verified end to end; refresh rotation works; mongosh shows 108 chapters + 12 categories + admin

## Phase 1 — Public catalog & event lifecycle
- [ ] 1.1 Organizer apply → admin approve/reject + emails
- [ ] 1.2 Events CRUD in DRAFT, slug gen, banner presigned upload, ownership guards
- [ ] 1.3 Wizard UI (6 steps) saving drafts per step; step 3 Google Places Autocomplete → address/lat/lng/placeId (§8.7) + /geo/geocode fallback
- [ ] 1.4 Submit → PENDING_APPROVAL; admin queue approve/reject (+reason) + emails; state machine §6 in service layer
- [ ] 1.5 Public listing API (all filters + indexes); listing page with filter rail, cards, pagination, sort
- [ ] 1.6 Event details (booking card disabled) incl. embedded Google Map + directions on venue block, organizer profile, chapters directory (grouped by type/tier, flagship row) + chapter page (join/leave), home, search, share, viewsCount, react-helmet-async meta/OG
- [ ] EXIT: demo organizer takes an event draft → approval → public listing; browse/filter/chapters work logged out

## Phase 2 — Checkout, payments, ticketing
- [ ] 2.1 TicketTypes + PromoCodes CRUD (wizard steps 4–5 live)
- [ ] 2.2 POST /orders atomic reserve ($expr guard in Mongo txn, §8.1) → PENDING/held draft order; order+payment state model §8.0; expiry cron + cancel
- [ ] 2.3 Razorpay order/verify/webhook (test mode)
- [ ] 2.4 Stripe intent/webhook (test mode)
- [ ] 2.5 Fulfilment §8.3: tickets, QR, PDF template, invoice, S3, emails
- [ ] 2.6 Checkout page (countdown, gateway selector) + success page
- [ ] 2.7 My tickets, ticket detail (QR, PDF, .ics), order history
- [ ] 2.8 Public validation page /t/:token
- [ ] EXIT: paid (both gateways), free, and promo flows produce tickets; PDFs in S3 + inbox; expiry restores inventory

## Phase 3 — Organizer & admin operations
- [ ] 3.1 Organizer dashboard KPIs
- [ ] 3.2 Registrations table + XLSX export (exceljs)
- [ ] 3.3 Check-in endpoint §8.4 + scanner page (html5-qrcode) + stats
- [ ] 3.4 Refund request → admin queue → gateway refund → webhook completion §8.5 + inventory restore + emails
- [ ] 3.5 Admin: users, organizers, events moderation (+feature toggle), transactions, categories CRUD, chapters CRUD (all hierarchy fields), CMS CRUD + public render, AuditLog on mutations
- [ ] EXIT: full dry run — create → approve → sell (test) → export → check in → refund one order

## Phase 4 — Reports, automation, launch
- [ ] 4.1 Reports aggregations §11 + admin reports page (recharts)
- [ ] 4.2 remind24h + completeEvents crons
- [ ] 4.3 Hardening: zod everywhere, helmet, CORS allowlist, webhook raw-body ordering, private S3 + signed reads
- [ ] 4.4 SPA SEO: server /sitemap.xml + robots, helmet meta/OG per event; branding pass (white + red #F84464 — obs-home-ui-prompt.md)
- [ ] 4.5 Deploy: Atlas (M0 dev / M10 prod), EC2 API (pm2 + nginx + certbot), React build on S3 + CloudFront, live webhook URLs, live-keys checklist
- [ ] EXIT: production URL serves a full booking flow

## Phase 5 — Community, content & programs (post-MVP · UI in obs-frontend-new-sections-ui-prompt.md)
- [ ] 5.1 Open chapter creation: POST /chapters (any user, isOfficial=false), PATCH (creator edits), GET /me/chapters, admin status/official/flagship; /chapters/create + /account/chapters + Community chapters section. Events stay organizer-gated.
- [ ] 5.2 Speakers: model + admin CRUD, /speakers + /speakers/:slug, organizer attaches speakerIds, speakers block + home rail
- [ ] 5.3 Sponsors & partners: Sponsor model (tiers/scope) + admin CRUD, /sponsors showcase + what-we-offer, event sponsors block, PartnerApplication + /become-a-sponsor → admin queue
- [ ] 5.4 Media: Article model + admin CRUD, /news + /news/:slug, newsroom rail
- [ ] 5.5 100 Days Program: Program + ProgramDay models, seed current edition (15 Oct→22 Jan, 100 days), /program overview (season status + country filter + day-by-day) + /program/day/:n, link events via programId/programDayNumber, home banner; repeats yearly
- [ ] 5.6 Ownership + Launchpad: event ownership OBS/Partner + All/OBS/Partner tabs (?owner); isLaunch/launchAt + /launches with countdowns + home rail
- [ ] 5.7 Frontend polish: AppLoader (initial) + RouteProgress bar + chapter-highlight hero band
- [ ] EXIT: user creates a community chapter; speaker/sponsor/article render; /program day-by-day works; owner tabs filter; /launches countdown

## Decisions
- Phase 0 setup (2026-07-08): DB for local build/verification = **MongoDB Atlas** (URI supplied by user, goes in server/.env — no local mongod on this machine). UI wiring scope for Phase 0 = **auth only** (login/signup/Google + role guards + real axios client in 0.5); all other client pages stay on mock data until their own phase. Chapter moderation default = APPROVED (§5). Client is already extensively built with mock data — do NOT rebuild it; integrate + wire per phase.
- Phase 0 task 0.1 (2026-07-08): the previously-committed root+server scaffold (commits 4e5635b, 9a06d24) had been deleted in the working tree; restored it (matches plan §13). Renamed the client workspace package `obs-events`→`client` (it collided with the root package name and broke `npm install` under workspaces). Consolidated the duplicate build-plan/progress files: `obs-events-build-plan new.md`/`PROGRESS new.md` were byte-identical to the unsuffixed files except CRLF line endings — removed the `*new*` copies and kept the unsuffixed names the plan/loop prompt reference. Added `.env` to .gitignore.
- v1.1: MERN stack; order items + invoice embedded in orders; all money as integer paise; ecosystemTier A–E added to chapters
- v1.3: email via Nodemailer (SMTP), provider-agnostic mailer util (env: SMTP_HOST/PORT/SECURE/USER/PASS + EMAIL_FROM) — replaces SendGrid; Node.js + MongoDB unchanged. chapter creation OPEN to any signed-in user (events stay organizer-gated) [CONFIRM: source said both — using chapters-open/events-gated]; new collections Sponsor, PartnerApplication, Speaker, Article, Program, ProgramDay; event fields ownership(OBS/Partner)/isLaunch/launchAt/programId/programDayNumber/speakerIds; chapter fields createdById/isOfficial/status; 100 Days = 15 Oct→22 Jan yearly; frontend prompt obs-frontend-new-sections-ui-prompt.md
- v1.2: explicit order+payment state model (§8.0, PENDING = draft/held); Google Maps Platform for venue autocomplete + geocode fallback + embedded map (§8.7); new keys GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (server) + VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (browser)

## Known issues / TODO
- Atlas connection string still needed from user for task 0.2 (seed + verify) and 0.3 (auth E2E). Put it in `server/.env` as `MONGODB_URI`.
- Google OAuth Client ID + Secret needed from user to verify "Google signup end to end" at task 0.3 (code will be built regardless).
- `npm install` reports 2 transitive dev-dep vulnerabilities (vite/esbuild chain) — deferred; fixing needs a breaking major bump, out of Phase 0 scope.
- Node here is v24 (plan targets Node 20); satisfies `engines: >=20`. No action needed.
- Client `/t/:status` route param vs plan's `/t/:token` — cosmetic mismatch to reconcile when the validation page is wired (Phase 2.8).

## Session log
- 2026-07-08 · task 0.1 (repo scaffold) — DONE
  - Files: `package.json` (root workspaces, restored), `server/package.json`, `server/.env.example`, `server/src/app.js`, `server/src/config/env.js`, `server/src/index.js` (restored); `client/package.json` (renamed pkg → `client`); `.gitignore` (+`.env`); removed `obs-events-build-plan new.md`, `PROGRESS new.md`.
  - Verified: `npm install` resolves all 3 workspaces (236 pkgs); `node server/src/index.js` boots and `GET /api/v1/health` returns `{ok:true,...}`; `npm run build --workspace client` compiles (104 modules, vite 5.4).
  - Learned: client is a BrowserRouter SPA (main.jsx → BrowserRouter+AppProvider→App) with ~30 pages driven by `src/mock/*` + `AppContext`; no backend calls yet. Server index.js does NOT connect Mongo yet (that's 0.2), so it boots standalone.
